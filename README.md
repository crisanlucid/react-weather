### the task
implement a very basic weather service called "myWeather"

### expectations
- it does not have to be a perfectly working solution
- it should not take more than 4-5h
- consider the use case of mobile and/or tablet users
- nice design as a plus

### note
if the solution requires setup (starting a server or docker-container etc.), please leave an instruction

### stories
as a user of myWeather I want to see the forecast in the city of my choice

###### AC
- there is an input, where the user can type the name of the city
- the value of the input can be submitted to the "myWeater"-Service
- when the form is submitted, the user sees a list/row of tiles for the upcoming days
- a tile shows temperature, min/max limits, and condition
- the condition is displayed with an icon (see zip)
  - if the condition can not be matched with an icon, use the "sunny"-icon
- the min and max temperatures are displayed in the corners of the current temperature in a form comparable to superscript and subscript
- if the user did an error or there is no such city in myWeather service, he gets notified
---

### resources
- please find a zip for icons in the folder
- for weather-data you can use [openweathermap](https://openweathermap.org/api)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br>
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
